<h2>Other Writings</h2>

<p>Despite all the fuss over <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, between 1925 and his death Tolkien did write and publish a number of other articles, including a range of scholarly essays, many reprinted in <i>The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays</i> (see above); one Middle-earth related work, <i>The Adventures of Tom Bombadil</i>; editions and translations of Middle English works such as the <i>Ancrene Wisse</i>, <i>Sir Gawain</i>, <i>Sir Orfeo</i> and <i>The Pearl</i>, and some stories independent of the Legendarium, such as the <i>Imram</i>, <i>The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm’s Son</i>, <i>The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun</i>—and, especially, <i>Farmer Giles of Ham</i>, <i>Leaf by Niggle</i>, and <i>Smith of Wootton Major</i>.</p>
<p>The flow of publications was only temporarily slowed by Tolkien’s death. The long-awaited <i>Silmarillion</i>, edited by Christopher Tolkien, appeared in 1977. In 1980 Christopher also published a selection of his father’s incomplete writings from his later years under the title of <i>Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth</i>. In the introduction to this work Christopher Tolkien referred in passing to <i>The Book of Lost Tales</i>, “itself a very substantial work, of the utmost interest to one concerned with the origins of Middle-earth, but requiring to be presented in a lengthy and complex study, if at all” (<i>Unfinished Tales</i>, p. 6, paragraph 1).</p>
<p>The sales of <i>The Silmarillion</i> had rather taken George Allen &amp; Unwin by surprise, and those of <i>Unfinished Tales</i> even more so. Obviously, there was a market even for this relatively abstruse material and they decided to risk embarking on this “lengthy and complex study”. Even more lengthy and complex than expected, the resulting 12 volumes of the <i>History of Middle-earth</i>, under Christopher’s editorship, proved to be a successful enterprise. (Tolkien’s publishers had changed hands, and names, several times between the start of the enterprise in 1983 and the appearance of the paperback edition of Volume 12, <i>The Peoples of Middle-earth</i>, in 1997.) Over time, other posthumous publications emerged including <em>Roverandom</em> (1998), <em>The Children of Húrin</em> (2007), <em>Beowulf</em> (2014), <em>Beren and Lúthien</em> (2017), and most recently <em>The Fall of Gondolin</em> (2018).</p>
